# Techiton Game
<i>A robotic Real-Time Strategy game with mechanical simplicity and annihilation in mind.</i>
<br>
*Built with [Unity3D](https://unity3d.com/) and inspired by [Total Annihilation (1997)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Annihilation).* 
<br>
### Please note: <i>Currently in pre-alpha and early stages of development!</i>
[Techiton.net](https://techiton.net)

  - The game itself is open source. 
  - Single-player will be free, forever, period.
  - An account will be optional and free for single-player and would only be used for tracking individual statistics and replays.
  - The account profile will be viewable from https://techiton.net/profile/<username>
    - Profiles will be hidden by default.
    - Profiles will show number of overall games, wins, losses, energy generated, metal generated, and time played.
    - The website will handle the maths for the generation and display of averages of the said values.

The plan for multiplayer is to have a small one-time fee of $3-5 to help in server costs.
This also includes replay storage and user account statistics.

(this also could help with phony account creation too)
* For the in-game login, imagine along the lines of the Warcraft III login screen but with a robotic theme.
* Game lobbies and general chat will be displayed after login. (visualize Diablo II's lobby)* 
* If an account is not flagged for multiplayer, then it will be rejected and will hyperlink to the game page.


This is basically how I document, design and develop:
GitKraken is essentially part of my workflow (and pay a subscription for GitKraken Pro).
[GitKraken Glo](https://www.gitkraken.com/glo) board Kanban cards 
Let me know if you would use it!  Only rule is to create a new card in the ideas column unless you're developing something.
I can send you an invite via email and let me know what you're interested in working on.

This game is connected to a launcher client to allow for patching and displaying of news and patch notes, which is located [here](https://github.com/jacobbetz/techiton-launcher)
The game will run without the launcher client but does not have the capability to auto-update itself.
I would recommend using the [techiton launcher](https://github.com/jacobbetz/techiton-launcher) to launch the game instead.
