<i>A robotic Real-Time Strategy game with mechanical simplicity and annihilation in mind.</i>

This game is connected to a launcher client to allow for patching and displaying of news and patch notes, which is located [here](https://github.com/jacobbetz/techiton-launcher)
The game will run without the launcher client but does not have the capability to auto-update itself.
I would recommend using the [techiton launcher](https://github.com/jacobbetz/techiton-launcher) to launch the game instead.
